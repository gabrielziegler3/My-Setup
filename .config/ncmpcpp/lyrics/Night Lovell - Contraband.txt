She hit me up like what you need
I got houses in the trees
I got shit you never think that people ever really see
Hit me up like what you need

Now I got hoes I got twenty-thousand freaks, ya
Making white bitches get rosey in they cheeks, ya
I got problems with this condo on the beach, ya
Can't ruin my shit I put these bitches on a leash, ya
Don't bring no niggas when you step into mi casa
I got two separate rooms for Sammi and for Lanna
Stupid niggas always watching from the corner
I be so bad to let them think for much longer
That I'm always on the move for the cheese
Talking like you wanna be my friend, bitch please
I seen this shit many fucking times
You staying for the top
You such a fucking bitch you never throw a fucking dime, ya
Lost up in the mess with all these people and they overlay
I can't take this shit I only seem to fucking complicate

Fuck all the molly
Know my niggas they got me
I just count up this cash
And buy myself a Bugatti, done talking

In San Diego, I count up some pesos
Be with some nice bitches
And all of them deep throat
Fuck am I talking for
I flex till I'm ninety-four
Been through a lot of shit, so the fuck you gone try me for
I catch a body though
I'll take your audi dawg
Don't understand the move, and you talking like [?]
Talking so damn much, but this ain't no poppet show
I press the damn clutch, and load up the shotty though
Don't think you shot me dawg
Don't think you got me, I got the world in a party
I fuck your bitch as a hobby
I don't think nobody saw me
When I was down in the lobby
Looking for things that would take me straight from this place and I'm sorry
That I told you I'm sorry
I be telling these lies
From the core of my body
My thoughts flow like dasani

Can't keep stressing over shit I can't change
Bitch I'm fucked in all ways, and I just came to say
That I'm done
