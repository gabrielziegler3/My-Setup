[Bones:]
Say good night, as I draw the blinds
I know I've always stayed in the morning light
Hold on, let me draw the line
The sun goes down, then I feel alright
I know you and you know me
Before I met you, I had a longing
For something real, something tangible
Being by myself is a handful

Oh no, made me say it again
Oh no, made me say it again
Oh no, made me say it again
Oh no, made me say it again

I know you and you know me
Don't make me say it again
I know you and you know me
Don't make me say it again
I know you and you know me
Don't make me say it again

[Bones & Eddy Baker:]
Everything you do is so familiar
I miss the sight of you hanging around
Everything you say is so familiar
Remember the times you would hold me down?
No, you changed
Life's all strange
No, you changed
Life's all strange
